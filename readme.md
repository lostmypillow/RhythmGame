# Programming Finals Proposal
## Members: Peggy 110540011, Johnny 110540029

## Title:
　　Simple yet fun Rhythm Game~

## Abstract:
　　Rhythm games are a type of game that requires users to press buttons on their screens in a certain rhythm according to the notes on the screen. In this project, we plan to design a simple model of a rhythm game, including two anime characters on the side cheering you on, dancing as you press 4 different keys: up, down, left and right according to the notes. Think Cytus and osu! but much simpler and easier to play.

## Idea Description:
　　Peggy loves drawing and Johnny loves programming. We want to combine each other’s interest in a project; therefore, we come up with making a simple model of a rhythm game. Peggy will be responsible for designing the anime characters and all the graphics in the project, and Johnny will be in charge of the overall coding. We hope people will enjoy the game we design.

## Technical Implementation:
　　For drawing, Peggy will use an iPad and Apple Pencil to design the characters and graphics in an App called “MediBang Paint”.

As for programming, Johnny will use HTML, CSS, jQuery and hopefully transition to Vue.js to finish his project.

The website will consist of a home page and the game page itself.
The home page will contain a splash screen and a small cluster of mini musical notes following your cursor.
The game itself will have 4 vertical lanes, each lane corresponds to a key (up down left right), each lane will have a static image of the keys at the bottom.
Keys will drop down from the top and travel down the vertical lane, the moment the generated key overlaps the static key, the player clicks the corresponding key on the keyboard on time and accurately and earns points.
Each successive key press generates a combo, the higher the combo, the larger the points multiplier.
There are 2 anime characters on the side, everytime you press a key, the characters spin and show the anime character jumping, cheering…etc.
In the end the player will be presented with the total points. (for now)

## Roadmap:
v0.1 Character design and basic Vue.js implemented
v1.0 Graphics all completed and game operable
